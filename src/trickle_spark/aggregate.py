"""Incremental grouped aggregation: the ``.aggregate(by, **metrics)`` machinery.

Raw accumulators live in a **state companion** Delta table ``{output}__trickle_aggstate`` (per additive
column a running sum, non-NULL count and centred moment M2; per extreme a stored min & max; per
co-moment pair the paired ``(n, Σx, Σy, M2x, M2y, Cxy)`` over rows where both are non-NULL; per
weighted unit Σ(w·x), Σw and a pair count; per argmin/argmax the supporting key + payload; per
semigroup the reduced value; per product the sign/zero counts + Σ log|x|). The published output holds
only the derived user columns — a clean table like any other trickle-spark output.

**Incremental path** (an input Z-set ΔO): fold the distributive sums additively per affected group
(O(δ)); maintain M2 by the parallel **Chan/Pébay merge-in/merge-out** of centred moments computed
about the delta partitions' own means (two passes — numerically well-conditioned, never
``Σx² − (Σx)²/n``); the extend-or-rescan families (min/max/arg/bool/bit) extend in place from the
inserts, but a group with **any retraction rescans its current membership** (the supporting row may be
gone). Emit ``new (+1) ⊎ old (−1)`` for the affected groups — old read from the **current output
table** (materialised — no reconstruction). **Comprehensive path**: rebuild the accumulators wholesale
and let the run diff the derived output. A group whose count reaches 0 is dropped and retracted.

**Two-table atomicity** (the one seam in the no-control-plane story, per ``docs/design.md``):
the state companion and the output cannot commit together, so the order is **state first, output
second**, each commit carrying the same pinned-version map. A re-run after a crash-between sees the
state already at the run's pins and **fast-forwards** — the state write is skipped and the output delta
is derived from the (already-updated) state against the (not-yet-updated) output. Any other divergence
between the state's pins and the output's watermarks falls back to a comprehensive rebuild.
